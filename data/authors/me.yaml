bio: |
  I am an Astrophysics PhD Candidate at the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center (NCAC PAS) \url{https://www.camk.edu.pl/en/} in Poland, 
  currently bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational data. 
  With a background in Engineering Physics from Delhi Technological University and an MS in Astrophysics & Cosmology from the University of Padova, 
  I approach astronomical problems with a first-principles mindset and a robust technical toolkit.
