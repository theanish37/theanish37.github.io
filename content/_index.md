        My current research at **NCAC PAS** focuses on **detached eclipsing binary stars** — studying stellar evolution through precise determination of fundamental stellar parameters (masses, radii, temperatures, luminosities). Eclipsing binaries are among the most powerful tools in astrophysics for testing stellar evolution models, and I work on characterising them with high-precision photometric and spectroscopic observations.

        For my Master's thesis, I carried out a **spectro-photometric study of B/Be stars** in the open cluster Trumpler 11 using data from the Gemini Observatory, supervised by Prof. Lydia Cidale (UNLP) and Dr. Antonino Milone (UniPd).

        I am also broadly interested in **X-ray binaries** — I contributed to a comprehensive catalogue of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) in the Galaxy, combining INTEGRAL and Gaia data. I have also applied **unsupervised machine learning** methods to stellar cluster membership determination (Gaia DR3) and to classifying GRB plateau properties.
