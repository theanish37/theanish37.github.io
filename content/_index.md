        My research focuses on **observational stellar astrophysics**, with a particular emphasis on B/Be stars in open clusters and their spectro-photometric properties. For my Master's thesis, I carried out a detailed study of the B/Be star population in the open cluster **Trumpler 11** using photometric and spectroscopic data from the Gemini Observatory.

        I am also broadly interested in **X-ray binaries** — I contributed to a comprehensive catalogue of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) in the Galaxy, combining data from INTEGRAL and Gaia. Additionally, I have worked on applying **unsupervised machine learning** methods (GMM, DBSCAN, pyUPMASK) to stellar cluster membership determination using Gaia DR3 data, as well as classifying GRB plateau properties.

        At NCAC PAS, I am working under the supervision of Dr. Krzysztof Helminiak on close binary star systems.
